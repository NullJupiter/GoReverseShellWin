# TCP reverse Shell for Windows
### Description:
This is a reverse shell for Windows to allow you remote access to the PC it's running on. It writes itself into the registry to run on startup. It also tries to reconnect to the given IP every minute if the connection is lost.
### What I learned:
- I learned using the net, bufio and os/exec packages
- I learned gerneral input output transmission of commands
