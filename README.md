# TCP reverse Shell for Windows
### Description:
This is a reverse shell for Windows to allow you remote access to the PC it's running on. It has no implementation of working after a reboot but an implementation for reconnecting to the listener one minute after losing connection to the listener.
### What I learned:
- I learned using the net, bufio and os/exec packages
- I learned gerneral input output transmission of commands
